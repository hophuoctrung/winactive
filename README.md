> I don't have the money to buy a Windows license, and the constant notifications are quite ðŸ˜¢ So, I searched for ways to activate it for free on the internet. I came across a lot of confusing information before finally synthesizing a method that works for me. This is just a simple script to automate the activation process - (for people like me who are financially challenged ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢) - and I also wanted to try my hand at writing .cmd scripts ^^
